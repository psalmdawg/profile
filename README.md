#Name: Paul Salmon

#####Age: ...over 30!

I am endeavouring to change careers and become a web developer... this seems harder than it looks!  
I was working underground, now hopefully remaining to work on the upper levels or tall buildings.

*(humorous...)

I dream of being able to be in control of my career, to have in demand skill and being a leader in my field.

I dream of the easy life. 

#Goals: To make it to the end
